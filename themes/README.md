This directory contains the theme resources and must be distributed
with the game. New themes can be added (up to 9) provided that they
have this structure:

- `tiles.png`: texture of all the tiles. The image must be
  128 pixels high and contain the 16 square tiles in increasing order.
- `icon.png`: 128x128 image for the icon and on-screen logo.
- `font.ttf`: font used for the on-screen texts.

Fonts have their own license. Graphics are released under the same license as the game itself.

Included themes (tile images are displayed):
1. Default for this clone of 2048
![Theme 1](1/tiles.png?raw=true "Theme 1")
2. Classic, original colors of 2048
![Theme 2](2/tiles.png?raw=true "Theme 2")
3. Regular stars
![Theme 3](3/tiles.png?raw=true "Theme 3")
4. Hexadecimal numbers
![Theme 4](4/tiles.png?raw=true "Theme 4")
5. Roman numerals
![Theme 5](5/tiles.png?raw=true "Theme 5")


The original vectorial images for the tiles have been drawn with
Inkscape and are provided in [../images](../images) directory.
